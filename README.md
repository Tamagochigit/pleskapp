# PleskApp CLI

PleskApp CLI is a tool that is installed on your local machine (not on the Plesk one) to manage Plesk remotely from the console. Target audiences are experienced administrators and developers who like to speed up the operations, automate routine procedures, manage the things using CLI.

Current development status is "early alfa version".

# How to Build

The utility is written in Go, so standard toolchain should be used to build the binary:

`go build`
